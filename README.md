# mover.tuning
Rewriting the mover tuning plugin for Unraid from the ground up in PHP with an object oriented approach to support new features and better efficiency.

New features coming:
- Improved threshold feature: with a trigger threshold (existing) and a target threshold (new feature) - usage only drops to the target %
- Mulitple cron schedules for different Shares / share groups
- Mover tuning for array->cache as well
- Multi-language support
- Progress menu
- Mover reports
- More refined customisations / tuning options
- Potentially: Threshold feature for individual datasets, not just on the pool level
